# A virtual reality game for hand rehabilitation

[Check us out!](http://v-hab.herokuapp.com/index.html)

This game uses the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) controller with the [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) JavaScript library to practice some simple hand movements to improve fine motor control.

Using the Leap Motion controller to track hand movements and the THREE.js library to give it a 3D look and feel you can practice movements like pinching and grabbing. The 3D environment helps with spacial recognition.
